Project intending to webscrape information from the official python library reference into Anki notes.

Uses AnkiConnect https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect/ to interface with Anki.

To operate the project run scrapePython.py then,
configure the directory/file hierarchy according to the deck separation desired then,
run addNotes.py

For convenience my json outputs are included in the notes directory and my final deck
is included as AnkPyDeck.apkg
